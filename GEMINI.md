# Literaku - Project Context

## Overview
Literaku is a modern, full-featured Book Review & Digital Library platform built with Next.js 14 and Supabase.
It allows users to:
- Read digital books (PDF) in a library interface.
- Write, rate, and share detailed book reviews.
- Engage with the community via likes and comments.
- Receive real-time notifications.
- Manage their profile and reading history.

## Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js (v5) + Supabase Adapter
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (Buckets: `library-covers`)
- **State/Fetching**: SWR, Axios

## Key Features & Files
### 1. Library & PDF Reader
- `/app/[locale]/library`: Grid of available books (fetched from `books` table).
- `/app/[locale]/read/[slug]`: PDF Reader interface.
- Component: `components/reader/ReaderInterface.tsx` (PDF Iframe + Notes Sidebar).
- **Admin**: `/app/[locale]/admin/upload` for uploading new PDFs.

### 2. Reviews System

- `/app/[locale]/dashboard/reviews`: Manage (Edit/Delete) own reviews.

### 4. Notifications

## Database Schema Highlights
- `books`: Stores PDF info (title, author, pdf_url, cover_url).
- `book_reviews`: User reviews linked to `books` (metadata duplicated for flexibility) or independent.
- `categories`: Book genres.
- `profiles`: User data (synced with Auth).
- `notifications`: Activity alerts.

## Current Status
- **Core**: Stable & Production Ready.
- **UI**: Modern Bento Grid, Dark Mode supported.
- **Pending**: 
  - Advanced Admin Dashboard implementation (currently only Upload).
  - Social login providers (Google/GitHub) need real keys.

## Quick Start
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Ensure `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
